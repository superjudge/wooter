Wooter is very simple Twitter clone. The purpose of Wooter is to
serve as an educational project, where different features of
Django and Python can be exemplified and explained.

In particular, the current data model of Wooter is na√Øve, and
will most likely break down for moderate amounts of users and
traffic.

Wooter is still very much work in progress.
